Factory Pattern: Database connection factory

Quality Assessment:
Pattern Appropriateness:
Good fit for database connection management
Encapsulates connection creation logic
Makes the system extensible
Follows Single Responsibility Principle

SOLID Principles:
Single Responsibility: Each class has one purpose
Open/Closed: Easy to add new database types
Liskov Substitution: All implementations are interchangeable
Interface Segregation: Clean interface design
Dependency Inversion: Depends on abstractions

Code Quality (Score: 8/10):
Clean interface design
Proper error handling
Thread safety considerations
Good test coverage
Configuration through properties

Improvements Needed:
Add connection pooling
Implement retry mechanism
Add more comprehensive logging
Add connection health checks
Implement connection timeout handling



2. Observer Pattern: Event notification system
Quality Checklist
Proper event hierarchy design
Thread-safe listener management
Proper error handling
Null checks in event creation
Comprehensive documentation
Proper resource cleanup
Spring integration
Logging implementation

Pattern Appropriateness
Good fit for event notification
Decouples event producers from consumers
Easy to add new event types
Easy to add new listeners
Supports multiple observers
Maintains loose coupling

SOLID Principles
Single Responsibility: Each class has one purpose
Open/Closed: Easy to extend with new events/listeners
Liskov Substitution: All events are substitutable
Interface Segregation: Clean listener interface
Dependency Inversion: Depends on abstractions
